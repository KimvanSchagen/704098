                            As technology advances, we can observe a need to Integrate the latest technologies in the sport sector to create competitive advantages. One of these 
                            technologies is the ‘smart goggles’, which is a combination of the latest wearable technologies and analytics. As the name suggests, the device is a 
                            high-tech pair of goggles developed for swimmers. It is meant to replace a coach by observing and analyzing an athlete’s technique and performance and 
                            generate strategies for improvement. The device itself features a display and sensors. Its data can be synced to a smart device of your choosing. An 
                            athlete can use these goggles to get accurate data about their form and find ways to improve.

                            As winning and losing in sports like competitive running and sprints is often a matter of a few seconds, one can imagine the need to innovate one’s 
                            footing. The product ‘sensor socks’ serves exactly this purpose. The socks help athletes improve their performance using sensors and data analytics. These 
                            socks are infused with several textile sensors that measure the different parameters of cadence, foot landing technique and impact as an athlete runs. 
                            This information is then processed by a virtual coaching algorithm developed by the company which in turn provides the athlete with steps they can take to 
                            improve their performance.

                            Any boxer can express the importance of the cadence, impact, speed and endurance of their punches during a fight. The product ‘punch trackers’ is an 
                            innovation for pro boxers designed to coach them. Much like other integrations involving wearable technology and analytics, it analyses a boxer’s 
                            performance and feeds the data in an analyzer to produce some strategy for the boxer. The interesting thing to note is that with a punch tracker, one can 
                            train individually at their home without requiring a sparring partner or a coach.
