                    As technology advances, we can observe a need to Integrate the latest technologies in the sport
                    sector to create competitive advantages. One of these
                    technologies is the <em>‘smart goggles’</em>, which is a combination of the latest wearable technologies and
                    analytics. As the name suggests, the device is a
                    high-tech pair of goggles developed for swimmers. It is meant to replace a coach by observing and
                    analyzing an athlete’s technique and performance and
                    generate strategies for improvement. The device itself features a display and sensors. Its data can
                    be synced to a smart device of your choosing. An
                    athlete can use these goggles to get accurate data about their form and find ways to improve.

                    As winning and losing in sports like competitive running and sprints is often a matter of a few
                    seconds, one can imagine the need to innovate one’s
                    footing. The product <em>‘sensor socks’</em> serves exactly this purpose. The socks help athletes improve
                    their performance using sensors and data analytics. These
                    socks are infused with several textile sensors that measure the different parameters of cadence,
                    foot landing technique and impact as an athlete runs.
                    This information is then processed by a virtual coaching algorithm developed by the company which in
                    turn provides the athlete with steps they can take to
                    improve their performance.

                    Any boxer can express the importance of the cadence, impact, speed and endurance of their punches
                    during a fight. The product <em>‘punch trackers’</em> is an
                    innovation for pro boxers designed to coach them. Much like other integrations involving wearable
                    technology and analytics, it analyses a boxer’s
                    performance and feeds the data in an analyzer to produce some strategy for the boxer. The
                    interesting thing to note is that with a punch tracker, one can
                    train individually at their home <em>without</em> requiring a sparring partner or a coach.
