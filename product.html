                <h2>Smart swimming goggles and how to use them:</h2>
                <p>
                    Smart swim goggles are the worlds <em>first</em> augmented-reality swim goggles. It combines latest wearable-tech 
                    and data analytics to make a virtual coach for the athletes. These ordinary looking swimming goggles 
                    feature a series of sensors that record the wearer’s performance as well as feature a display on the 
                    lens. Upon purchase, a professional swimmer can download the corresponding app and sync it with their 
                    smart goggles. The goggles virtual display will also show the athlete a timer, their speed, and other 
                    various stats of their choosing. The applications smart algorithm stores a large amount of information 
                    specifically developed to generate proper advice for the swimmer, based on their personal goals.

                <h2>What do the smart goggles measure?</h2>
                <p>
                    The smart goggles measure various different statistics. These stats include the laps, time, distance, 
                    heartrate, split times, stroke rate, stroke count, distance per stroke, calories burned and so on. 
                    They essentially measure the entirety of the swim broken down into every possible statistic which can 
                    be measured using their developed algorithm. Based on the personal goals of the athlete, one specific 
                    skill can be targeted to be improved. For example, the heart rate and distance per stroke is a very 
                    significant metric for a triathlon athlete whose goal is to conserve their energy as much as possible.

                <h2>What is the future of smart goggles?</h2>
                <p>
                    Technological advances have hardly been easy to predict but one can expect that high-tech wearable 
                    technologies are here to stay in the sporting industry. One can already use smart swimming goggles for 
                    personal use, but all trends point towards them becoming a staple in every swimming athlete training 
                    regimen. These goggles will also be able to measure the likeliness to get injury as well generate newer 
                    techniques using AI in the future. Also using virtual reality, athletes should eventually be able to 
                    recreate their experience of swimming without having to do so with a possibility of sharing it, 
                    ultimately allowing for an <em>unprecedented</em> rate of collaboration.

                <h2>How smart goggles are changing the competitive swimming industry:</h2>
                <p>
                    Innovations like the smart swimming goggles are turning sports into a calculable science. Because of 
                    the high degree of efficiency these goggles can generate, coaches could rather use the goggles to 
                    monitor their athletes’ performance. A competitive swimmers entire swim can be monitored in great detail 
                    to be analyzed by the coach and can be used to build strategies. Smart goggles are allowing athletes to 
                    tackle the problems which would not be otherwise possible due to human-limitations.

                <h2>A swimmer’s personal experience with smart goggles:</h2>
                <p>
                    For professional swimmers, smart goggles are a great tool to monitor and improve their performance. 
                    Many athletes like competitive triathlete Collin Sherrick were asked to share their personal experience 
                    with the product. “Having data on the screen has helped me make progress in real time” Colin said when 
                    expressing his delight with the product. He claimed to have improved his stride and speed in the 50 and 
                    100m relays and heavily advocates the product to his cohorts. Many athletes like him have testified to 
                    seeing measurably better results after using the product.

                <h2>Are smart goggles worth the money?</h2>
                <p>
                    Smart goggles feature latest wearable technology with waterproof sensors and a smudge free display. 
                    It stands to reason that this device is not cheap. A pair of these goggles will set you back anywhere 
                    between 200 to 500 euros depending on their build quality and features as well as a subscription fee for 
                    the app that will analyses the athlete’s data. This poses the question if they are worth the money. Many 
                    athletes have testified to seeing results but unless you are a professional competitive swimmer, one can 
                    argue that this level of tech is <em>not</em> necessary for you especially if you lack the basic understanding of 
                    how to apply the generated analysis from the app.
